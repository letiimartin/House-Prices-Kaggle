# House-Prices-Kaggle
This repository contains my work on the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". The challenge was to predict the sales price for each house, for which I explored and utilized various regression techniques and data preprocessing methods.

#### Main Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed features to better suit the modeling phase.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the data and gain valuable insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Crafted new features and selected significant variables to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:** Implemented and fine-tuned multiple machine learning models, including Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, and CatBoostRegressor.

#### Results:
Achieved a score of 0.12673, ranking at position 617 out of 3983 participants. This repository showcases the dedication, learning, and experimentation process behind this achievement.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts to understand the workflow and methodologies applied. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
